PubChemPy documentation
=======================

PubChemPy provides a way to interact with PubChem in Python. It allows chemical searches by name,
substructure and similarity, chemical standardization, conversion between chemical file formats, depiction and
retrieval of chemical properties.

Here's a quick example showing how to search for a compound by name::

    for compound in get_compounds('glucose', 'name'):
        print compound.cid
        print compound.isomeric_smiles

Here's how you get calculated properties for a specific compound::

    vioxx = Compound.from_cid(5090)
    print vioxx.molecular_formula
    print vioxx.molecular_weight
    print vioxx.xlogp

All the heavy lifting is done by PubChem's servers, using their database and chemical toolkits.

Features
--------

- Search PubChem Substance and Compound databases by name, SMILES, InChI and SDF.
- Retrieve the standardised Compound record for a given input structure.
- Convert between SDF, SMILES, InChI, PubChem CID and more.
- Retrieve calculated properties, fingerprints and descriptors.
- Generate 2D and 3D coordinates.
- Get IUPAC systematic names, trade names and all known synonyms for a given Compound.
- Download compound records as XML, ASNT/B, JSON, SDF and depiction as a PNG image.
- Construct property tables using *pandas* DataFrames.
- A complete Python wrapper around the `PubChem PUG REST web service`_.
- Supports Python versions 2.7 â€“ 3.4.
